This repository serves as the foundation for the *{lab_name}* workshop. It contains all the neccessary manifests and steps to reproduce the used stack and approaches from the workshop.
*{lab_name}* is a project that serves as a practical tutorial for detecting anomalies in wind turbines through computer vision visual inspection. This workshop provides an example using *{ocpai}*, exploring use cases of MLOps and DevOps methodologies, and offering the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in deploying ML models for real-world applications. Delving into the ML infrastructure sections, you will navigate through use cases pertinent to MLOps and DevOps engineers, while focusing on the practical tasks involved in ML application development for anomaly detection in wind turbines. 

== What to expect

In the workshop (and by following along the documentation), you will get in touch with various tools for an (opnitionated) AI/ML workflow. These tools for example include:  `PyTorch`, `Jupyter Notebooks`, `Kafka`, `Knative`, `MinIO`, `OpenShift` (with *{ocpai}* ) and others. You will set those up and be able to understand how these components interact with each other. You will be able to set up and initiate the training of a model, make it available for inferencing and deploy the infrastructure and runtimes, all in a cloud native fashion on Kubernetes (OpenShift).

== Lab Overview

This repository serves as a mono repository containing source codes of applications for this use case as well as manifests (yamls) to deploy resources on OpenShift. Usually you will split applications and infrastructure resources in separate repositories with different responsibilities. For the sake of this workshop and to make it easier accessible, we merged it all into one.

=== Lab structure

|===
| File | Description

| Prerequisites
| The applications of this use case will use certain services we need to install on our OpenShift cluster. We will need services like Serverless, AMQ Streams (Kafka) and *{ocpai}*. This guide will explain how to install those.

| Model Training
| For this use case we want to train a model which will be capable of finding anomalies in wind turbine images. We will use the capabilities of {ocpai} to do so. This guide will explain how to use *{ocpai}* for our workshop.

| Configure and Test Model Serving
| We will test the model and once everything else is set up, we will deploy our actual applications which will make use of the now existing infrastructure of OpenShift services and the AI stack. This guide explains how to deploy them all correctly.
