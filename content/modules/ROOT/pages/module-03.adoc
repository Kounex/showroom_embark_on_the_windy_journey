= Model Training

== Explore and run the model training notebook

* Navigate to `windy-journey/ml/pytorch` and open `01_Visual_Inspection_YOLOv5_Model_Training.ipynb`
* Explore or explain and run cells step by step
 ** Setup and test the Ultralytics YOLOv5 toolkit
 ** Inspect training dataset (image and labels)
 ** Model training
  *** _Model training can take ~30 minutes or more even with GPUs. You could jump to <<model-serving,Model Serving>>, use a pre-trained model and come back later._
 ** Model validation
 ** Convert model to onnx format and upload it to S3

NOTE: the notebook's cells contain output messages from a previous successful run. This is so you could explain the demo without actually run anything (i.e. no GPUs required, etc...). But in order to run the demo yourself, you need to run every cell successfully _once_, even if the outputs might suggest is has already run.
