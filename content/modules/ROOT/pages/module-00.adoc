= Getting acquainted with {ocp}

For those who are already familiar with {ocp}, feel free to skip this section as head directly to the prerequisites. If you are new to {ocp} or just want a short refresher, this is for you!

== Accessing the {ocpc} (Web UI)

The easiest way to interact with an {ocp} cluster, is to make use of the {ocpc}, which is a web application granting you a visualization of the cluster and also enables you to interact with it. You are also able to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to do so which will be explained later in this module.

For now, open up your browser of choice and head over to {console_url}. There you will be greeted by the login page. Select "Local" and use the following credentials:

* {user}
* {password}

Once logged in, you will see the {ocp} dashboard:

Here you will find some high level / general purpose information of the state of your cluster like the overall status of the operators, control plane and so on. Further down you can also see some hardware resource utilization of your cluster:

Since your provided user has admin privileges on the cluster, you are automatically on the "Administrator" view which can be seen on the top left corner, right under the {ocp} logo. There you can also toggle between the "Administrator" and "Developer" view which are, as the name indicates, targeted for different audiences / use cases. The Developer perspective provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as the ability to:

. Create and deploy applications in various ways directly from the UI
. Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with them within a project and monitor their deployment and build status.
. Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications.

As an admin, you can simply swap between both by clicking on the dropdown button:

== Navigating the {ocpc}

Feel free to explore and switch between the Administrator and Developer views as both have certain advantages depending on what you want to do. Generally speaking the Administrator view focuses more on splitting and showing the different resources which are available on {ocp} while the Developer view focuses on applications on {ocp}, therefore it's more straight forward to deploy, manage and observe your applications and the processes (like CI/CD) from there.

Throughout the workshop you will have to create resources in {ocp}, like `Deployment`, `Secret`, `Service` etc. These will be in `YAML` format, just like the existing resources you can see in {ocp}. To create such resources, simply click on the plus symbol at the upper right hand corner:

This will open up a text area box where you an simply drop the resource definitions you want to add to the {ocp} cluster:

NOTE: As seen in the screenshot, you can add multiple resources at once by making use of `---` (three dashes) to separate resources. You will see this in action in some of the YAML resources being presented throughout the workshop.
