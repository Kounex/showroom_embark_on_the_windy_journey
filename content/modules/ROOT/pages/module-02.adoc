= {ocpai} workbench 

Switch to the {ocpai} web console, navigate to "Data Science Project" and select your project `{user}`. You can now see its initial state. There are five types of project components:

* *Workbenches* are instances of your development and experimentation environment. They typically contain IDEs, such as JupyterLab, RStudio, and Visual Studio Code.
* A *Cluster storage* is a volume that persists the files and data you're working on within a workbench. A workbench has access to one or more cluster storage instances.
* *Data connections* contain configuration parameters that are required to connect to a data source, such as an S3 object bucket.
* *Pipelines* contain the Data Science pipelines that are executed within the project.
* *Models and model servers* allow you to quickly serve a trained model for real-time inference. You can have multiple model servers per data science project. One model server can host multiple models.


== Create a data connection 

*Data connections* contain configuration parameters that are required to connect to a data source, i.e. Minio in this case.

. Under *Components* click on *`Add Data connections`* in *Data Connections*

. Fill out the *Add data connection* form with the following information. These data were already set earlier in xref:module-01.adoc[Prerequisites]

* Name: `{global-name}`
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: `minio`
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: `minio123`
* AWS_S3_ENDPOINT: `+http://minio.{user}.svc.cluster.local:9000+`
* AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: `us-east`
* AWS_S3_BUCKET: `{global-name}` 
+

. Once done, click on *Add Data Connection*

== Create a workbench

A *workbench* is an instance of your development and experimentation environment. Within the workbench you can select a notebook image for your data science work. We will be using *Windy Journey Lab Notebook* as our notebook image. We will also use the data connections we just created.

. Click on *`Create workbench`* under Components

. Fill out the form with the following information:

* Name: `{global-name}`
* Image: `Windy Journey Lab Notebook` 
* Deployment size: `Small`
* Number of GPUs: 0
* Cluster storage: `Create new cluster storage`
* Data connection: `Use existing data connection` \-> `{global-name}`

+
. Click on *`Create workbench`*.
. You will see that it is *starting* in the *status*. Wait until the *Status* shows `running`

. Open the workbench and clone https://github.com/sa-mw-dach/windy-journey.git (there are at least 4 ways to do this - find out the approach you like)
