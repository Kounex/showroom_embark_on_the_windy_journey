= Setup a RHODS workbench 

== Create new RHODS workbench for Ultralytics Pytorch YOLOv5

* Log in to the OpenShift web console
* Launch RHODS via the application launcher (nine-dots) \-> *`Red Hat OpenShift Data Science`*
* Create a new Data Science project \-> *`Create data science project`*.
+
If you have your own OpenShift cluster, you can name the project 'wvi'. If not add your initials. E.g. 'wvi-stb' or team number like 'wvi-1'.
Don't choose too long names, because project and model server names are internally concatenated, which could lead into problems.

 ** Name: `+wvi-{your-name}+`
 ** Resource name: `windy visual inspection `
 ** \-> *`Create`*.

* Create a data connection with your S3 configuration
 ** Data connections \-> *`Add Data connections`*.
 ** Name: `+wvi-{your-name}+`
 ** AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: `minio`
 ** AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: `minio123`
 ** AWS_S3_ENDPOINT: `+http://minio-service.minio.svc.cluster.local:9000+`
 ** AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: `us-east2` (it seem this cannot be empty)
 ** AWS_S3_BUCKET: `+wvi-{your-name}+`
* Create new RHODS workbench
 ** Workbenches \-> *`Create workbench`*.
 ** Name: `+wvi-{your-name}+`
 ** Image: `Windy Journey Lab Notebook` 
 ** Deployment size: `Small`
 ** Number of GPUs: 0
 ** Cluster storage: `Create new cluster storage`
 ** Data connection: `Use existing data connection` \-> `+wvi-{your-name}+`
 ** \-> *`Create workbench`*.
* Note, in case the workbench does not start, please check if LimitRanges block the pod. Find the created project in the OpenShift console, navigate to Administration \-> LimitRanges and delete the LimitRange that was auto created.
* Open the workbench and clone https://github.com/sa-mw-dach/windy-journey.git (there are at least 4 ways to do this - find out the approach you like)
